  abstract = {Spectroscopic analysis of physiological phenomena has remained an important yet underutilized application in wearable technology today. Lumos has recently been introduced as an open-source wearable device capable of on-body spectroscopic research across the visible spectrum, enabling scientists and researchers to study the optical properties of various clinical biomarkers in real-time. However, a key limitation in the data output of this device is the lengthy process required to visualize and plot the spectral responses of observed mediums. In this paper, we present SpectraVue, an interactive web application that allows for visualization of Lumos spectral data. Utilizing a user-friendly interface, SpectraVue enables researchers to quickly generate three-dimensional plots from Lumos data stored in csv or text files, providing a comprehensive view of the spectral response of the medium under investigation. Additionally, SpectraVue offers features such as comparison of spectral data with a clinical biomarker, various data export options, and interactive plotting, further enhancing the user experience and researcher efficiency. The output graphs can be used to provide a standardization of spectral responses across a wide range of mediums, including characterization of these responses in clinical biomarkers such as glucose and alcohol. SpectraVue aims to facilitate these investigations by streamlining the data processing and visualization workflow, thereby accelerating clinical diagnostic research.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
