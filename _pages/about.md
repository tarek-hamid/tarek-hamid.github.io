I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD student at [UVA](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/electrical-and-computer-engineering), advised by [Dr. Amanda Watson](https://amandawatson.org). Before starting my PhD, I held various roles at [Sotera Digital Health](https://soteradigitalhealth.com/), [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), and [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.jnj.com/). I received my Master's degree from Johns Hopkins University and my Bachelor's degree from The College of New Jersey. 

My research focuses on the detection of various physiological biomarkers using off-the-shelf wearable devices, including glucose, blood pressure, skin-tone, macronutrients, and lactate. My primary interests are in digital health, wearable devices, medical cyber-physical systems, and applied machine learning.
