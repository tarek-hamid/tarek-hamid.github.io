I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD student at [UVA](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/electrical-and-computer-engineering), advised by [Dr. Amanda Watson](https://amandawatson.org). Before starting my PhD, I held various roles at [Sotera Digital Health](https://soteradigitalhealth.com/), [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), and [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.jnj.com/). I received my Master's degree from Johns Hopkins University and my Bachelor's degree from The College of New Jersey. 

My research focuses on developing signal processing and machine learning algorithms for multi-wavelength photoplethysmography (PPG) to detect various physiological biomarkers including blood pressure, skin composition (melanin/erythema), macronutrients, and lactate. I work with multi-spectral optical sensing data from wearable platforms to enable continuous, non-invasive monitoring across various physiological domains. My primary interests are in digital health, wearable devices, medical cyber-physical systems, and applied machine learning.
