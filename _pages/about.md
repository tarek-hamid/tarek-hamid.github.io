I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD student at [UVA](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/electrical-and-computer-engineering), advised by [Dr. Amanda Watson](https://amandawatson.org). Before starting my PhD, I held various roles at [Sotera Digital Health](https://soteradigitalhealth.com/), [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/), and [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.jnj.com/). I received my Master's degree from Johns Hopkins University and my Bachelor's degree from The College of New Jersey. 

My research focuses on developing signal processing and machine learning algorithms for multi-wavelength photoplethysmography (PPG) to detect various physiological biomarkers including blood pressure, skin composition (melanin/erythema), macronutrients, and lactate. I work with multi-spectral optical sensing data from wearable platforms to enable continuous, non-invasive monitoring across various physiological domains. My primary interests are in digital health, wearable devices, medical cyber-physical systems, and applied machine learning. 

In general, I am interested in exploring how enhanced spatial and contextual resolution in wearable sensing can improve detection of physiological biomarkers. My recent work explores how richer optical information can reveal physiological context that traditional PPG cannot capture. By directly sensing confounders and the underlying mechanisms of the PPG waveform, and by incorporating multi-site measurements, alternative form factors, and environmental context, we can supply the additional information needed for systems to generalize reliably across diverse users and real-world conditions.
